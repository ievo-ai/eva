# Sources Index

Append-only log of external news / docs / release sources Eva scans during research runs (Step 4 of `.github/workflows/eva-research.yml`).

## Format

Each level-2 heading (`## <URL>`) is one source. Inside the section:

1. A ` ```yaml ` fenced block with the latest scan metadata
2. A `**Summary:**` line — the most recent observation
3. A `History:` bulleted list — chronological scan log, newest at top

YAML schema (required keys, future pre-commit may enforce):

```yaml
last_scan: <ISO 8601 UTC timestamp or "never">
status: <first-scan | changed | unchanged | error>
run_id: <GitHub Actions run ID or null>
```

## How Eva uses this file per run

- **Pre-scan (Step 1):** read each URL section to know the prior state (status, last summary). Build a diff map.
- **Post-scan (Step 4):** for each URL scanned, update the YAML block atop the section AND prepend a new entry to History. Use the `Edit` tool to modify only the relevant section — never rewrite the whole file.
- **New URLs:** if you find a source not yet listed, add a new section at the bottom following the same format.

## Status semantics

- `first-scan` — bootstrap entry, never visited yet
- `changed` — content differs from last scan (worth deep summary)
- `unchanged` — content matches last scan (brief note, skip deep dive)
- `error` — fetch failed, 404, rate-limited, or otherwise unavailable

**Summary:** Claude Code Routines — scheduled sessions on Anthropic-managed infra. Created via `/schedule` CLI command, claude.ai/code/routines web UI, or Desktop app sidebar. Account-level config (Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise required). Triggers: cron, HTTP API POST, GitHub events (PR/release). Not available if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN is set. F-2026-05-25-002 (schedule skill) was implemented (skills#84 closed/completed).

**Summary:** Claude Code Channels — push events from Telegram/Discord/iMessage into Claude Code sessions. Research preview, requires Bun. Plugin-based (`/plugin install telegram@claude-plugins-official`), then `claude --channels plugin:...`. Enterprise: `channelsEnabled: true` managed setting. Still in research preview — not actionable for iEvo skills yet.

History:
- 2026-05-31T00:00:00Z — unchanged: still in research preview; Bun required; no GA announcement; not actionable
- 2026-05-30T07:15:49Z — unchanged: still research preview; Bun required; no new GA timeline visible
- 2026-05-29T07:38:29Z — unchanged: still research preview; Bun required; not GA; defer /ievo:channel-setup proposal
- 2026-05-27T07:38:00Z — changed: still research preview but significantly expanded with platform-specific setup guides, enterprise allowlist, dev testing flag; not GA yet — defer /ievo:channel-setup until GA
- 2026-05-25T07:48:17Z — first-scan: Channels in research preview; Bun required; push events from Telegram/Discord/iMessage

**Summary:** Official Claude Code sub-agents documentation. Documents `effort:` as a valid agent frontmatter field (low/medium/high/xhigh/max) — overrides session effort when the agent runs. Also documents `disallowedTools`, `permissionMode`, `maxTurns`, `skills`, `mcpServers`, `hooks`, `memory`, `background`, `isolation`, `color`, `initialPrompt`. Resolution order for `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`: env var > per-invocation param > frontmatter > main session model. Plugin subagents ignore `hooks`, `mcpServers`, `permissionMode`. No agent nesting. Triggered F-2026-05-31-002 (effort: validation for validate_agents.mjs).

History:
- 2026-05-31T00:00:00Z — first-scan: effort: field documented for agents; 12+ frontmatter fields documented; CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL resolution order confirmed; triggered F-2026-05-31-002
- 2026-05-29T07:38:29Z — first-scan: effort/isolation/memory/background agent fields documented; iEvo agents lack effort: → triggered F-2026-05-29-002
- 2026-05-26T07:30:00Z — first-scan: model resolution order confirmed; forked subagents (experimental) noted; skill preloading via frontmatter noted; triggered awareness of missing vuln-scan orchestrator (F-2026-05-26-001)

**Summary:** Project Glasswing vulnerability scanning research. Multi-phase: Mythos Preview detection → security personnel triage → fix verification → maintainer reports. Results: 1,752 vulnerabilities, 90.6% true positives (1,587), 62.4% confirmed high/critical. Infrastructure: scanning harness maps codebase + spins up scanning subagents; triage + threat modeling for prioritization. Key insight: exploit-chain validation requirement is what achieves high true-positive rate vs traditional SAST. Bottleneck: remediation lag (~2 weeks for high/critical despite fast detection).

History:
- 2026-05-26T07:30:00Z — first-scan: multi-phase orchestration architecture documented; 90.6% true-positive rate via exploit-chain validation; triggered F-2026-05-26-001 (missing vuln-scan orchestrator)

**Summary:** Claude Code sub-agents documentation. Resolution order for `model:` frontmatter: (1) `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` env var if set, (2) per-invocation parameter, (3) agent frontmatter `model:`, (4) main-conversation model. This order means operator env vars override iEvo agent frontmatter — the security-auditor / vuln-scanner degradation risk documented in AGENTS.md security model section. Sub-agents spawned via Task tool; dispatched sessions honor `agent` field in settings.json (v2.1.157+). `context: fork` in SKILL.md frontmatter runs skill in forked subagent.

History:
- 2026-05-30T07:15:49Z — first-scan: sub-agent model resolution order documented; context:fork frontmatter; settings.json agent field; CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL precedence confirmed
- 2026-05-27T07:38:00Z — first-scan: confirmed CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL resolution order; disallowedTools and isolation: worktree documented; model resolution security note in AGENTS.md is accurate
